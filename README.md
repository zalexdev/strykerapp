Hey everyone,

Thank you for all the time we've shared and for being part of the Stryker community. Your support, feedback, bug reports, and trust over the years have meant more than words can express.

**As of today, Stryker App will no longer receive updates, and the servers have been officially shut down.**

It's been an incredible ride — from the first alpha back in July 2021 to 140,000+ installations and a passionate community of security enthusiasts around the world. None of this would have been possible without you.
